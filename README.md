This project focuses on analyzing sales and profit trends over time, identifying top-performing categories and sub-categories, and deriving actionable insights for business growth. Using Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we explore data-driven solutions to improve decision-making.
1. What is the trend of sales and profit over time?
2. Which regions and markets contribute the most to sales and profit?
3. Which cities and states are the most profitable?
4.Which products are the most popular (highest quantity sold)?
5.What is the sales and profit distribution across different markets?
